# Search — Design & Implementation Plan

Status: **BUILT** (all 12 milestones + Phase 2 collapsible groups & pagination, on `main`,
committed as of 2026-07-03). Backend: `src-tauri/src/search/{db,extract,index,query,state}.rs`
— 18 unit/integration tests green (up from 14), release build clean. Frontend:
`src/lib/search.svelte.ts` (store), `src/lib/components/SearchView.svelte`, wired into
`src/routes/+page.svelte` (new **Search** view) with jump-to-hit in `SessionEditor.svelte`.
Phase 2 remaining (see below): keyboard nav, tool-name + current-session filters.

**Deviations from the spec below (intentional):**
- `blocks` gained a **`uuid`** column — the frontend regroups entries into turns and flattens blocks,
  so raw `line_no` can't locate a hit; `(uuid, block_no)` survives regrouping and drives jump-to-hit.
- The cold tier **scans** un-cached sessions for correctness but does **not** write the cache from the
  read path (avoids write-lock contention); the background indexer warms the cache instead.
- Search opens a dedicated **read** connection (`db::open_read`, no schema DDL) so it never contends
  with the indexer's write transaction.

Original spec follows.

## Phase 2 — VS Code parity follow-ups (2026-07-03)

User feedback after using Phase 1: results should read like VS Code's search panel (per-file
match previews — already true), collapsible per-file groups, pagination to cut loading overhead,
and richer filtering. Status of each:

1. **Collapsible per-session groups — DONE 2026-07-03.** `SearchView.svelte`: each group header is
   now a `<button>` with a `▾`/`▸` chevron; clicking toggles a local `collapsed: Set<sessionPath>`
   `$state`, reset via `$effect` whenever `search.query` changes (new search = fresh result set).
   Purely a frontend change, no backend/store changes needed.

2. **Real pagination / backend limit — DONE 2026-07-03.** Added `limit: Option<usize>` to the
   `search` Tauri command + `search_streaming` + `scan_blocks` (cold path). Both tiers now stop
   scanning/snippet-building/sending once `summary.hits >= limit` and set `summary.truncated = true`.
   Frontend: replaced the hard `MAX_DISPLAY_HITS = 1000` client-side cap with a `PAGE_SIZE = 100`
   server-side limit; `loadMore()` bumps limit and re-runs; "Load more results…" button in
   `SearchView.svelte` when `moreAvailable`. New queries + filter changes reset `limit` to page 1.
   All 18 Rust tests green, `pnpm check` + `pnpm build` clean. Files: `query.rs`, `state.rs`,
   `api.ts`, `search.svelte.ts`, `SearchView.svelte`, `types.ts`.

3. **Keyboard navigation (↑/↓/Enter across hits) — NOT STARTED.** No ↑/↓ + Enter to move
   between hits today (mouse-only). Plan: track a focused hit index in `SearchView.svelte`, wire
   `keydown` on the results container (↓/↑ move focus across the flattened, collapse-aware hit
   list; Enter calls `onJump` on the focused hit; skip collapsed groups' hits when navigating).

4. **Tool-name + current-session filters — NOT STARTED.** Two independent, additive filters:
   - **Tool-name filter**: restrict to `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks for a specific tool (e.g.
     only `Bash` or `Edit` calls). Likely a `LIKE` prefix filter on `blocks.text` (tool_use text
     starts with the tool name per §5 extraction rules); confirm the exact format in
     `search/extract.rs` before committing.
   - **Current-session-only filter**: restrict search to the currently-open session's path. Needs
     one new optional `session_path: Option<String>` on `SearchFilters` + a `WHERE b.session_path =
     ?` clause in `candidate_sql`.
   - Explicitly **out of scope**: model/git-branch filtering (needs new columns + reindex).

Priority if resumed: #3 (keyboard nav) first — smallest lift, highest feel-improvement — then #4
(tool-name + current-session filters) as additive follow-ups.

## 1. Goal

VS Code-style search across all Claude Code history: fast, substring/regex, streaming results,
with filters for **source** (message / thinking / tool), **date range**, and **project** (multi-select).
Empty filters = search everything.

The guiding principle: **the user never waits.** Results stream in as they're found; each keystroke
cancels the previous search; the index is a pure accelerant that search never blocks on.

## 2. Why "like VS Code" changes the engine (key decision)

VS Code search is **not** a tokenized full-text index — it's ripgrep (Rust) doing fast
**substring/regex scans**. That's why it supports regex, whole-word, and case toggles and still
feels instant. FTS5's tokenized matching can't do arbitrary regex and has awkward
word-boundary / ≥3-char behavior.

So we do **not** tokenize. We substring/regex-match like ripgrep. SQLite stays, but its role
changes from "FTS5 inverted index" to **"extracted-text cache"**:

- The expensive part of searching JSONL is **JSON parsing**, not matching. A raw ripgrep over
  `.jsonl` would match JSON escapes, UUIDs, and metadata keys → garbage hits. We must parse each
  line and extract the clean human text first.
- So we cache the **extracted text** (one row per content block) in SQLite, invalidated by an
  mtime+size fingerprint. Search then runs the Rust `regex` engine over the cached text.
- The `regex` crate has the same SIMD literal-prefiltering that makes ripgrep fast, so this *is*
  essentially VS Code's engine, just fed pre-cleaned text.

## 3. Two-tier model (correctness never waits on the index)

- **Cold** (no cache for a session): read + parse the JSONL directly, extract, match, stream.
  Works immediately; slower. The cold scan **doubles as indexing** — it populates the cache as it
  goes, so the first search warms things up.
- **Warm** (cache present & fresh): scan the cached text — no JSON parse — much faster.
- A background task builds/refreshes the cache. Search is always correct; it just gets faster as
  the cache fills. There is no "index not ready" state the user has to think about.

## 4. Data model (SQLite, NOT FTS5)

DB at `~/.claude/.ccstudio-index/search.db` (same convention as `.ccstudio-edits` / `.ccstudio-backups`).
The DB is a **disposable cache** — always rebuildable from source JSONL — so we use aggressive,
non-durable pragmas for speed: `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=OFF` during bulk build
(checkpoint at end), large transaction batches.

```sql
-- One row per session file, for invalidation.
CREATE TABLE session_files (
  session_path TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  project      TEXT NOT NULL,   -- home-relative label (from real cwd)
  mtime        INTEGER NOT NULL,
  size         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  indexed_at   INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- One row per extracted, searchable content block.
CREATE TABLE blocks (
  session_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  project      TEXT NOT NULL,   -- denormalized for cheap filtering
  ts           INTEGER,         -- message timestamp (epoch ms), for date filtering
  line_no      INTEGER NOT NULL,-- 0-based line index in the JSONL (for jump-to)
  block_no     INTEGER NOT NULL,-- index of the content block within that line's message
  source       TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'user'|'assistant'|'thinking'|'tool_use'|'tool_result'
  text         TEXT NOT NULL    -- extracted plain text
);
CREATE INDEX blocks_session ON blocks(session_path);
CREATE INDEX blocks_project ON blocks(project);
CREATE INDEX blocks_ts      ON blocks(ts);
CREATE INDEX blocks_source  ON blocks(source);
```

**Source multi-select is a query-time filter** (`WHERE source IN (...)`), never a reason to
reindex — we always extract & store all sources. UI mapping:
- **Messages** (default on) → `source IN ('user','assistant')`
- **Thinking** → `source = 'thinking'`
- **Tool calls** → `source IN ('tool_use','tool_result')`

## 5. Extraction rules (what text each source yields)

Mirror `parser.ts`'s `extractContentBlocks` document-order semantics so `line_no`/`block_no` line
up with what the editor renders (needed for jump-to-hit):

- `user` / `assistant` text blocks → the text string.
- `thinking` blocks → the thinking text.
- `tool_use` → the tool name + a flattened, readable rendering of its input JSON (so searching a
  file path or command inside a tool call works).
- `tool_result` → the result's text/stdout (flattened; skip pure binary/base64).

Each extracted block records `(line_no, block_no, source, ts, text)`.

## 6. Invalidation (no filesystem watcher)

We deliberately do **not** use a `notify`-style fs watcher — this repo lives inside
`~/.claude/projects/`, and watchers here hit EMFILE (the same reason `npm run dev` is banned).
Instead:

- **Fingerprint** = `(mtime, size)` per session file in `session_files`. On a sweep, `stat()` each
  file and compare; mismatch or missing row ⇒ stale. Cheap: we only read files we're re-indexing.
- **Granularity = per session file.** Claude Code appends lines; our own Save rewrites the whole
  file. Either way the unit of change is "this file changed." Reindex = `DELETE FROM blocks WHERE
  session_path=?`, re-extract, bulk insert, upsert `session_files`.
- **Two triggers:**
  1. **Eager** — our own Save / Save-as-copy / Restore know exactly which file changed → push it
     onto an immediate reindex queue.
  2. **Lazy sweep** — on launch + every N minutes, low-priority background thread. Catches external
     changes (the CLI appending to an open session, edits outside the app).
- **Deletion cleanup** — the sweep removes `session_files` rows whose path no longer exists and
  cascades `DELETE FROM blocks`, so removed sessions stop appearing in results.

## 7. Rust concurrency (the fun part / the learning goals)

Producer/consumer: **parse in parallel, write serialized.**

- Fan session files across a bounded worker pool (rayon or N std threads). Each worker reads +
  `serde_json`-parses + extracts blocks — CPU/IO-bound, parallelizes well.
- Workers push extracted rows down an `mpsc` channel.
- **One** writer thread owns the `rusqlite` connection and does batched `INSERT`s inside big
  transactions. SQLite allows a single writer at a time — this is the canonical shape.

Rust concepts we'll hit (good learning surface): ownership across threads (`Arc`, `Send`/`Sync`),
`Result`/`?` error handling, `mpsc` channels, `rayon` parallel iterators, C FFI via `rusqlite`
(bundled SQLite), and the `regex`/`aho-corasick` crates.

## 8. Search flow

1. Frontend sends `{ query, opts: {caseSensitive, wholeWord, regex}, filters: {sources[], from,
   to, projects[]} }` plus a Tauri `Channel` handle and a fresh cancellation id.
2. Rust builds a `regex::Regex` from the query (see §9).
3. **Candidate selection, recency-ordered:** `SELECT ... FROM blocks WHERE` (source/date/project
   filters) — for fresh sessions. Order candidate **sessions by mtime desc** (most recent first),
   blocks in file order within a session, so results stream in a **stable, append-only** order (no
   mid-list reordering → no flicker).
4. For **stale/missing** sessions in the filter set, fall back to the **cold path**: read+parse
   those JSONL files directly, applying the same filters + matcher, and opportunistically populate
   the cache.
5. For each candidate block, run the regex. On match, push a hit to the channel:
   `{ session_path, project, line_no, block_no, source, ts, snippet, matchRanges }`.
6. Check the cancellation token between blocks/batches; abort promptly if superseded.

## 9. Query semantics (unify all modes through the regex crate)

- **Plain (default):** `regex::escape(query)` → literal substring match.
- **Whole word:** wrap with `\b…\b`.
- **Regex:** use the query as-is (compile errors surface as a gentle "invalid regex" hint, no
  results thrown away destructively).
- **Case:** `RegexBuilder::new(...).case_insensitive(!caseSensitive)`.

The `regex` crate auto-applies literal prefiltering (memchr/Aho-Corasick/SIMD), so even a scan over
a large text column is fast — this is what makes the "no tokenizer" approach viable.

## 10. Cancellation & ordering (anti-flicker)

- **Per-keystroke cancellation, not just debounce.** Each new query cancels the in-flight one via a
  `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` (or an atomic generation counter checked in the scan loop).
  Debounce alone lets a slow stale scan finish and stream results *after* a newer query started —
  the classic flicker/revert race.
- **Stable order:** candidate sessions sorted by recency up front; results only ever **append**.
- Light debounce (~80–120 ms) on top, purely to avoid launching a scan per literal keystroke.

## 11. Tauri command surface (draft)

```rust
// Streaming search. Pushes SearchHit messages onto `on_hit` as they're found.
#[tauri::command]
async fn search(
    query: String,
    opts: SearchOpts,          // { case_sensitive, whole_word, regex }
    filters: SearchFilters,    // { sources: Vec<String>, from: Option<i64>, to: Option<i64>, projects: Vec<String> }
    search_id: u64,            // for cancellation (newer id supersedes older)
    on_hit: tauri::ipc::Channel<SearchHit>,
) -> Result<SearchSummary, String>;   // summary: total hits, sessions touched, whether cache was cold

// Kick a background (re)index sweep; safe to call often (no-ops if fresh).
#[tauri::command]
async fn refresh_index() -> Result<IndexStatus, String>;

// Cheap status for a subtle "indexing… N%" indicator.
#[tauri::command]
fn index_status() -> IndexStatus;   // { total_sessions, indexed_sessions, building: bool }
```

Streaming uses **`tauri::ipc::Channel<T>`** (Tauri v2's ordered high-frequency Rust→JS primitive),
not `emit` events (which get lossy/slow at volume).

## 12. Frontend (SvelteKit)

- **New top-level Search view** (sibling of Browse), reachable from the header. (Placement TBD —
  see §14.)
- A `search.svelte.ts` store: holds query, opts, filters, and a reactive `hits` array. On query/
  filter change → debounce → bump `search_id` → open a `Channel` → call `search` → **append** each
  incoming hit to `hits`. A newer search_id makes the store ignore late hits from the old one.
- **Filter UI:** search box + three toggle buttons (Aa case, `\b` whole-word, `.*` regex, like VS
  Code); a **source multi-select** (Messages default-checked, Thinking, Tool calls); a date-range
  picker (from/to); a project multi-select (checkbox list of known projects).
- **Results:** grouped by session (session header = home-relative project + title + date), each hit
  a row with a snippet and the matched substring highlighted (`matchRanges`). Click a hit → open
  that session and **scroll to `line_no`/`block_no`** (needs a small "scroll-to-block" entry point
  added to the editor). Reuse the existing session-open path.
- **Subtle index indicator** somewhere unobtrusive ("indexing 42/120…"), driven by `index_status`.

## 13. Crates to add (src-tauri)

- `rusqlite = { version = "0.32", features = ["bundled"] }` — bundled SQLite (compiles from
  source; no system dep). We use plain tables, not FTS5.
- `regex` — the matcher.
- `rayon` — parallel parse (or hand-rolled `std::thread` pool; rayon is simpler to learn first).
- `tokio-util` — `CancellationToken` (Tauri already pulls tokio). Or roll an `AtomicU64` generation
  counter (simpler, fewer deps — decide when we build).
- (`serde_json` is already present.)

## 14. Open decisions (confirm when we build)

1. **Search view placement:** dedicated top-level view (recommended) vs. a search panel bolted into
   Browse. Leaning dedicated view.
2. **Cancellation mechanism:** `tokio_util::CancellationToken` vs. an `AtomicU64` generation counter.
   Leaning the atomic counter for simplicity + fewer deps (good first-Rust choice).
3. **rayon vs. std::thread pool** for parse fan-out. Leaning rayon (less boilerplate to learn on).
4. **Sweep interval N** and whether to sweep on every window focus vs. a timer.
5. Whether to show match **context lines** (VS Code shows the matching line; our "line" is a
   message block, so the snippet is a windowed excerpt around the match — confirm excerpt length).

## 15. Build milestones (learning-paced; do in order)

1. **Schema + rusqlite hello-world**: open/create `search.db`, create tables, a trivial insert/
   select round-trip. (Learn: `Result`, `?`, the bundled-SQLite build, borrowing a `Connection`.)
2. **Extraction in Rust**: port `extractContentBlocks` semantics; unit-test against a mock JSONL
   fixture so `line_no`/`block_no` match the frontend.
3. **Single-threaded indexer**: read a dir of sessions, extract, bulk-insert in a transaction;
   fingerprint into `session_files`. Verify counts.
4. **Invalidation sweep**: mtime/size compare, reindex-stale, delete-missing.
5. **Parallelize**: rayon parse → mpsc → single writer thread. Measure the speedup.
6. **Matcher + `search` command (warm path only)**: SQL prefilter → regex scan → return a Vec
   first (no streaming yet). Wire a minimal frontend results list.
7. **Streaming**: switch to `Channel<SearchHit>`; append in the store.
8. **Cancellation + debounce**: per-keystroke supersede; kill the flicker race.
9. **Cold-path fallback + cache-warming**: scan un-indexed sessions directly, populate as we go.
10. **Filters UI**: source multi-select, date range, project multi-select.
11. **Jump-to-hit**: scroll-to-block in the editor; highlight.
12. **Polish**: index-status indicator, empty/no-results states, regex-error hint, tests.
```
