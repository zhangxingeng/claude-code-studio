# Prompt Library — Interaction Contract

Status: **living UX contract, in review** (founder Round-B feel-check, 2026-07-10; branch
`prompt-library`, unshipped — no release contains this feature). This is the sibling to the
[engineering contract](prompts-design.md): where that doc says *what the system is* (storage,
schema, the Rust↔JS command surface, the variable grammar, copy output), this one says *what the
user does and what happens back*. The two touch at named seams; where a UX rule here forces a
contract change, it is listed under [Contract implications](#contract-implications) and nowhere
else — the lead amends the contract from that list before any build.

It ages with the code, and it is meant to be tweaked over time. Read it as a **diff**: every
scenario is tagged **Today** (what the current code does) and **Change** (what this round asks
for) so a builder knows what to preserve and what to move. Several behaviors the founder asked
for already exist — those say so plainly, because the cheapest change is the one you don't make.

The north star, in the founder's words: *"streamline all use scenarios so the user can be as
mouse-off as possible."* Every mouse affordance in this doc has a keyboard equivalent, or the
gap is called out as a defect to fix. The product voice is **Apple, not geek**: plain, quiet,
confident. This doc's voice holds itself to the same bar.

Naming note: **`piece` is renamed to `snippet`** everywhere (UI copy, identifiers, command and
schema names) as one mechanical commit in the build phase. This doc uses "snippet" throughout;
where it names a current symbol (`ComposeBox`, `composeInsertPiece`) it names today's symbol so a
builder can find it, and the rename sweep renames those too.

---

## Conventions — the rules every scenario inherits

State these once; the scenarios below assume them. They exist so a user *infers* what a key does
in a situation this doc never enumerated, rather than memorizing a table.

- **Enter accepts. Escape cancels the innermost open thing.** In a modal, Enter saves and Escape
  closes. In a popover, Escape closes. In a rebinding field, Escape abandons the capture. The one
  deliberate exception is the compose box itself, where Enter is a newline (you are writing prose)
  — the match panel earns Enter only after you have explicitly stepped into it (see
  [Newline search](#s2-newline-search--arrow--enter-insert)). The reason to bend the rule there:
  a multi-line prompt is the primary use, and silently turning the first Enter into an insert
  would eat newlines the user meant to type.

- **Escape unwinds one layer at a time, innermost first.** With the snippet modal open over the
  compose box, the first Escape closes the modal and returns the caret to where it was in the box;
  it does not also blur the box. A user should never lose two contexts to one keypress.

- **Focus is always restored to where attention was.** Opening a modal/popover moves focus into
  it; closing it returns focus to the control that opened it (or the compose caret, when the
  trigger was the box). This is a hard requirement, not a nicety — see
  [Popover geometry & focus](#popover-geometry-focus-trap-and-escape).

- **Situational affordances stay; one save control is always present.** The Round-A rule holds —
  Copy appears only when the box has text, edit chips appear only on a linked span — with a single
  walk-back: **`Save as…` is always visible** (bottom-left of the box), because "save what I just
  wrote" is a first-class intent that should never require producing a selection first.

- **Notifications are transient; data events are recoverable.** Every toast auto-dismisses after
  **5 seconds**. A toast that reports a *data* event (a JSON auto-repair) also leaves a durable
  trace the user can return to — a transient surface must never be the only record of something
  that touched their files.

- **The active tab is the scope, and switching it never edits your draft.** The tab sets the
  match pool, the default save target, and the tint. Your composed text is yours across tab
  switches; scope is a decision made *at save time*, not a mode the draft lives inside.

---

## The surface at rest

The Prompts view, top to bottom: the **scope tab row** (Global + pinned projects + a `⋯`
manager), then a two-column body — the **library/match panel** on the left (collapsible), the
**compose box** on the right. The compose box is the only place text is typed. A **settings gear**
opens a popover *above* the box. Situational affordances live on the box: `Copy prompt`
(bottom-right, only with text), `Save as…` (bottom-left, always), the floating save button (next
to a selection), the edit chip (above the box, when the caret is in a linked span), and the
**variable fill list** (below the box, when the text has variables).

---

## Scenario catalog

Legend: **Keys** = what the user presses; **Result** = the exact resulting state; **Today** vs
**Change** mark the diff.

### S1. Type, then copy the whole box

The plain path: write a prompt, copy it.

- **Keys.** Type in the box. `Ctrl/Cmd+C` with no selection, or click `Copy prompt`.
- **Result.** The composed text is resolved through the copy pipeline (escapes resolved; variables
  rendered per each variable's as-variable toggle — see [S4](#s4-fill-variables-per-variable-toggle))
  and placed on the clipboard. A 5-second toast confirms: *"Prompt copied."*
- **Today.** Copy is a button that appears bottom-right whenever the box has text
  (`ComposeBox` → `onCopy`). The toast lives 2.5s (`PromptsView.copyPrompt`).
- **Change.** Toast lifetime → 5s. Add the `Ctrl/Cmd+C` hotkey with the selection-aware rule in
  [S9](#s9-copy--button-and-hotkey).

### S2. Newline search → arrow → Enter-insert

The founder's favorite, half-built today. Each line you type is a live query; you pick a snippet
with the keyboard and it drops in.

- **Keys, in order.**
  1. Type a line, e.g. `senior review`. The match panel fills with ranked snippets for that line.
  2. `↓` (ArrowDown) from the box **steps focus into the panel**, highlighting the first hit.
  3. `↓`/`↑` move the highlight. `Enter` inserts the highlighted snippet. `Esc` returns focus to
     the box and dismisses the highlight, leaving your typed line intact.
  4. Press `Enter` in the box (not in the panel) for a normal newline — which **starts a fresh
     query** on the new line.
- **Result of insert.** The snippet's raw body **replaces the query line you typed** (the text
  from the line start to the caret) and lands as a `linked` span; the caret sits just after it;
  focus returns to the box. Variables in the body merge into the fill list.
- **Today.** The query *is* the current line up to the caret — `caretQuery` in `compose/doc.ts`
  already does `lastIndexOf('\n')`, so **newline-as-search-start already works**; this is the
  behavior that delighted the founder, and it needs no change. Arrow-nav *within* the panel also
  exists (`MatchPanel.handleKeydown`). **But** three things are missing: (a) there is no keyboard
  path from the box into the panel — you must click a hit; (b) `Enter` never inserts; (c) insert
  **appends at the caret** (`composeInsertPiece`), it does not replace the query line. So today the
  founder's "arrow and enter, no mouse" is impossible end-to-end.
- **Change.**
  - `↓` from the box moves focus to the first hit **only when the caret sits at the very end of
    the text and the panel has hits** — the one position where `↓` is natively inert in a
    textarea. Anywhere else `↓` moves the caret down a line, as it must: a user editing line 3 of
    a 10-line prompt would be rightly furious to have the arrow key stolen. Composing happens at
    the end, so this covers the real flow; mid-document insert stays a mouse click, a known and
    accepted gap.
  - `Enter` on a highlighted hit inserts. `Enter` in the box stays a newline.
  - Insert **replaces the query line** (`caretQuery`'s span: from the current line start to the
    caret) rather than appending. Rationale: the query text was scaffolding to find the snippet;
    leaving it in front of the inserted body is litter the user then has to delete.
  - `Esc` in the panel returns to the box without inserting.
- **Judgment call (JC-2).** Enter-inserts only *after* an explicit `↓` step into the panel; the
  first hit is not pre-armed to swallow Enter while the caret is still in the box. Auto-arming the
  first hit was rejected because it steals the newline key mid-compose.

  **JC-2 and query-line replacement are one decision, not two.** `caretQuery` treats the *entire*
  current line as the query, so an insert that replaces the query line also deletes whatever prose
  shares that line. That is safe only because the user opted in by stepping into the panel. Auto-arm
  the first hit and a stray `Enter` at the end of an ordinary sentence swallows the sentence. So if
  JC-2 is overruled, insert must **append at the caret** rather than replace — the two rules stand
  or fall together.

### S3. Insert by mouse (the equivalence)

- **Keys.** Click a hit in the panel.
- **Result.** Identical to the keyboard insert in [S2](#s2-newline-search--arrow--enter-insert):
  the query line is replaced, a `linked` span is created, the caret lands after it, focus returns
  to the box.
- **Today.** Click inserts at the caret without replacing the query line.
- **Change.** Same query-line replacement as S2, so mouse and keyboard produce one result. One
  insert path, two triggers.

### S4. Fill variables (per-variable toggle)

A snippet body like `Review {ticket:ABC-123} for {task}` exposes a fill list under the box: one
row per distinct variable, first-appearance order. This round makes **as-variable a per-variable
choice**, not one switch over the whole prompt.

- **What each row shows.** The variable name, a fill input (the default is the placeholder text),
  and an **as-var toggle** for *that* variable.
- **Keyboard nav.** `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` move between the box, each fill input, and each row's toggle
  in visual order. `Space` flips the focused toggle. Typing in a fill input updates the value
  live; the value serves every occurrence of that name across the whole document (grammar rule 4).
- **What the toggle does** (semantics from the [copy-output contract](prompts-design.md#copy-output--the-as-variable-toggle)):
  - **ON** for a variable → each occurrence copies as `<prompt_var name="x"/>` and the value lands
    once in the appended `<prompt_vars>` block. This is the dedup form — state a long value once,
    reference it inline, never repeat it and waste the reading model's context.
  - **OFF** → the value substitutes in place; an unfilled OFF variable leaves the canonical `{x}`
    visible (never silently blank).
- **Today.** A single `as variables` checkbox sits in the box (`ComposeBox`, bound to
  `prompts.asVariable`, persisted as `promptsAsVariable` in AppConfig). It flips **all** variables
  together. The fill list (`VariableFillList`) has no per-row toggle.
- **Change.** Remove the global checkbox. Each fill row gains its own toggle. The copy pipeline
  (`copyText`) takes a per-name ON/OFF map instead of one boolean. See
  [Contract implications](#contract-implications) — this kills the `promptsAsVariable` AppConfig
  field and changes the copy API's signature.
- **Judgment call (JC-1): the default keys off repetition, not length.** As-variable exists to
  avoid *repeating* content — the founder's words: *"repeating would be purely wasting context."*
  A variable that appears **once** costs strictly more as `<prompt_var name="x"/>` plus a block
  entry than it does substituted in place, however long its value. So: **a variable defaults ON
  when it occurs more than once in the document, OFF when it occurs once.** One sentence, and it is
  exactly the reason the feature exists.

  A length-based default ("ON when the value is long") was the first instinct and is wrong twice
  over: it pays the wrapper cost for a long value used once, and it keys off the *resolved value*,
  which changes as the user types into the fill input — the toggle would flip under their fingers.
  Occurrence count is stable. The default is computed **once, when the variable enters the list**,
  and never re-flips on its own; the moment the user touches a toggle, it is theirs. Overrule
  options: all-OFF, or all-ON (today's behavior, but it wraps one-word values in XML noise). This
  state is per-session, never written back to the snippet ([JC-9](#judgment-calls-collected)).

### S5. Save the whole box

- **Keys.** Click `Save as…` (bottom-left, always present) with no selection. Or the hotkey (see
  [S9](#s9-copy--button-and-hotkey) map).
- **Result.** The snippet modal opens prefilled with the **entire box text** as the body, scoped
  to the active tab, title empty and focused. `Enter`/`Save` writes it; `Esc`/`Cancel` closes.
- **Today.** There is **no way to save the whole box.** The only save affordance (`Save as piece`)
  floats next to a selection and `saveSelectionAsPiece` early-returns unless `hasSelection`. The
  founder may not realize whole-box save is currently impossible — this is the walk-back on
  Round-A's "no persistent buttons."
- **Change.** Add the always-present `Save as…` control. With a selection it saves the selection
  ([S6](#s6-save-a-selection)); with none it saves the whole box. One control, selection-aware.

### S6. Save a selection

- **Keys.** Select text (mouse drag, or `Shift`+arrows). The floating save button appears next to
  the selection end; click it, or use `Save as…`.
- **Result.** The snippet modal opens prefilled with the **selected text**, scoped to the active
  tab. On save, the selection becomes a `linked` span pointing at the new snippet
  (`composeLinkRange`).
- **Today.** Works as described (`ComposeBox` floating `Save as piece`, `saveSelectionAsPiece`).
  The floating button's only trigger is the mouse; the selection itself is keyboard-reachable but
  the button is not.
- **Change.** `Save as…` (S5) is the keyboard-reachable equivalent of the floating button, closing
  the mouse-off gap. Keep the floating button as the fast mouse path. Both show the **save
  scope** — see [S8](#s8-switch-project-tabs-with-a-draft-in-the-box).

### S7. Edit a linked snippet inline, then save — Update vs Save as new

The compose box is a scratch surface. Editing text inside an inserted span **never** mutates the
stored snippet on its own; the choice happens at save time.

- **Keys.** Place the caret in a linked span and type. The span becomes `linked-modified` (dotted
  underline). To reconcile, open the snippet: click the edit chip above the box, or double-click
  the span; the modal opens.
- **In the modal.**
  - The body shows the **current edited text by default**, with an **`Original`** button (next to
    `Delete`) that previews the stored original read-only — so the user sees what they diverged
    from without losing their edit.
  - Two save actions: **`Update snippet`** (writes the edit back as the canonical body — appends a
    version, never destroys the old one) and **`Save as new`** (creates a fresh snippet from the
    edited text, leaving the original untouched).
  - `Esc`/`Cancel` leaves both the snippet and the span as they are.
- **Today.** The modal opens showing the **stored** body, not the edited span text
  (`PieceModal`: `body = basePiece?.body ?? spanCurrentText`) — the opposite of what the founder
  asked. There is no `Original` button. Saving always updates the same snippet id; there is **no
  `Save as new`** branch. So this whole flow is a genuine build, and the default-body inversion is
  a real contradiction of the founder's stated model, worth confirming.
- **Change.** Default the modal body to the edited span text. Add `Original` (read-only preview of
  the stored body). Add the `Save as new` action beside `Update snippet`. After `Update snippet`,
  the edited span relinks to the (now-updated) snippet as `linked`; after `Save as new`, the span
  relinks to the new snippet.
- **Judgment call (JC-3): `Original` previews, it does not revert.** `Original` is a non-destructive
  peek. Reverting the edit (discarding the user's changes back to the stored body) is a separate,
  clearly-labeled `Revert to original` action, because a one-click "Original" that silently threw
  away the user's typing would be exactly the kind of surprise data-loss this product avoids.

### S8. Switch project tabs with a draft in the box

- **Keys.** Click a tab, or (see [Change]) `←`/`→` while a tab has focus.
- **Result.** The draft text stays exactly as it is. The match pool, tint, and **default save
  scope** switch to the new tab. Nothing is moved or re-scoped; cross-project reference is allowed.
- **Today.** Switching (`setActiveProject`) changes the match pool and tint and re-runs matching;
  the draft is untouched — **keep-content-on-switch already works.** Tabs are plain buttons
  (`Tab`-navigable, no arrow roving).
- **Change.**
  - **No nag.** The founder asked whether switching mid-selection should suggest moving to Global.
    Decision: never proactively. Scope is surfaced *at save*, not pushed at switch time.
  - **Save-time scope switch.** The `Save as…` affordance and the floating button show the target
    scope (the active tab) as a small label with a chevron; clicking it offers **Global** or
    another project in one step — so a snippet typed under one tab can be saved elsewhere without
    switching tabs first. The snippet modal's existing `Save to` selector is the same choice; keep
    them consistent.
  - **Keyboard tabs.** Give the tab row roving-tabindex `←`/`→` navigation with `Enter`/`Space` to
    activate, so scope is switchable mouse-off.

### S9. Copy — button and hotkey

- **Keys.** `Copy prompt` button (bottom-right, with text). `Ctrl/Cmd+C` hotkey.
- **The `Ctrl+C` resolution (this is the load-bearing edge).** `Ctrl+C` is owned by the OS/browser
  for copy-selection, and fighting that is user-hostile. So the binding is **selection-aware**:
  - With a **text selection** in the box → `Ctrl+C` does the native copy-selection. We do not
    touch it. Hijacking selection-copy would break the most reflexive shortcut on the keyboard.
  - With **no selection** → `Ctrl+C` copies the full composed prompt (the `Copy prompt` output)
    and shows the 5s toast. This is dead key-space natively (nothing is selected to copy), so we
    fill it without a fight.
- **Judgment call (JC-4).** Ship **one** binding, not two. The selection-aware `Ctrl/Cmd+C` above
  is the recommendation: it is the key the hand already reaches for, and it claims only the
  key-space the OS leaves empty. Overrule option: leave `Ctrl+C` entirely native and bind
  full-prompt copy to `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` instead — though that chord opens Chrome's element
  inspector, so it is clean inside the packaged app and contested in browser dev mode. Shipping
  both was rejected: two keys for one command is idle capability that reads as thoughtful and is
  really just upkeep. Whichever wins, the other is a rebind away.

### S10. Open and close the popovers

Three popovers exist: **settings/config** (gear), **project manager** (`⋯`), **snippet modal**.

- **Settings gear.** `Enter`/click the gear opens the popover **above** the compose box. `Esc` or
  click-away closes it; focus returns to the gear.
- **Project manager.** `Enter`/click `⋯` opens it under the tab row. `Esc`/click-away closes;
  focus returns to `⋯`.
- **Snippet modal.** Opens from the edit chip, a double-click on a span, `Save as…`, or the
  floating save button. `Esc`/`Cancel` closes; focus returns to the caret in the box.
- **Today.** The settings surface is the `EmbeddingsPopover` gear, anchored in the **library
  panel head** and opening **downward** (`top: 1.7rem`). The founder wants the settings popover
  **above** the compose box. All three have `Esc` handlers but **no focus trap and no focus
  restore** (a known Round-A follow-up).
- **Change.** Re-anchor the settings popover to open upward from a gear near the compose box (see
  [JC-5](#judgment-calls-collected)). Add focus trap + restore to all three — see
  [Popover geometry & focus](#popover-geometry-focus-trap-and-escape).

### S11. Download & index the semantic model

- **Keys.** Open the settings popover, click `Download & index`.
- **Result.** Two progress bars — Download (runtime + model) and Index (embedding the existing
  library). On completion the popover shows the enable toggle; lexical matching worked the whole
  time.
- **Today.** Works as described (`EmbeddingsPopover`, `startEmbedDownload`); the flow is sound.
  Only its **anchor** changes with S10 — it moves into the relocated settings popover.
- **Change.** None to the flow itself; it rides along with the settings-popover relocation.

### S12. Delete a snippet

- **Keys.** Open the snippet modal → `Delete` → it becomes `Really delete?` → click again to
  confirm. `Esc` at any point aborts.
- **Result.** The snippet file is removed. Spans in the box that pointed at it keep their text
  (they are point-in-time snapshots) but their link dangles; the edit chip falls back to a plain
  state. Deleting a **project** instead re-scopes its snippets to Global — nothing a user wrote
  ever vanishes as a side effect.
- **Today.** Works (`PieceModal.handleDelete` two-step confirm; `deleteProject` re-scopes). The
  two-step is a mouse pattern.
- **Change.** Keyboard parity: the confirm step is reachable by `Enter` on the focused `Delete`
  button (it advances to `Really delete?`, a second `Enter` confirms) — so destructive actions are
  never a mouse-only path, but still take two deliberate presses.

### S13. Toast lifecycle and recovering a repair notice

Two classes of message, and the difference matters:

- **Ephemeral confirmations** (copy succeeded, snippet saved): a 5s toast, then gone. Losing it
  costs nothing — the action already happened and is visible.
- **Data events** (a hand-edited snippet file was JSON-auto-repaired in memory; a snippet file
  couldn't be read at all): these touch the user's files and must be **recoverable after the toast
  vanishes**.
- **The recovery mechanism.** The transient toast announces the event for 5s. A durable trace
  lives on the **settings gear as a small badge** (a count of unresolved data events); opening the
  settings popover shows a **Notices** section listing each — the repaired snippet titles (with
  the "open and re-save to persist the repair" nudge) and any unreadable files. The badge clears
  when the underlying condition clears (the file is re-saved or fixed). This keeps the founder's
  "notifications should be temporary" while honoring "a data event must not disappear forever."
- **Today.** The recovered-pieces notice and the `pieceLoadErrors` notice are **permanent inline
  banners** (`PromptsView`); the recovered banner has no dismiss at all, the load-error banner
  dismisses per-mount. So today's behavior is the opposite extreme — permanent, not transient.
- **Change.** Convert both banners to the toast + settings-badge + Notices model above.
- **Judgment call (JC-5).** Housing the durable trace in the settings popover (rather than a
  standalone inbox) keeps the surface count low and matches the "config lives in a popover" line.
  Overrule option: a dedicated dismissible strip that only re-appears on a new event. Recommended
  against — a second persistent surface is exactly the clutter the popover consolidation avoids.

---

## Hotkey map

Scoped to the Prompts view (they arm on view enter, disarm on leave, and never fire while a modal
owns the keyboard). The global `Ctrl/Cmd+K` "go to search" (owned by `+page.svelte`) is unchanged
and takes precedence.

| Action | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Copy full prompt | `Ctrl/Cmd+C` (no selection) | Selection-aware — native copy wins when text is selected ([S9](#s9-copy--button-and-hotkey)). |
| Copy full prompt (alternative) | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` | Only if [JC-4](#s9-copy--button-and-hotkey) is overruled — **replaces** the row above, never ships beside it. Contested by Chrome's inspector in dev mode. |
| Save as… | `Ctrl/Cmd+S` | Selection-aware ([S5](#s5-save-the-whole-box)/[S6](#s6-save-a-selection)). Must `preventDefault` — the browser owns `Ctrl+S`. |
| Step into match panel | `↓` at end of query line | Not user-rebindable — it is a spatial nav key, not a command ([S2](#s2-newline-search--arrow--enter-insert)). |
| Insert highlighted snippet | `Enter` (in panel) | Context key, not rebindable. |
| Dismiss panel / close innermost | `Esc` | Universal; not rebindable. |

**Configurability — what it concretely means.** The *command* hotkeys (the top three rows) are
rebindable; the spatial/context keys are not, because rebinding `↓`/`Enter`/`Esc` would break the
inferable conventions the whole design rests on.

- **Storage.** A new `hotkeys` map in AppConfig (`command → chord string`), persisted through the
  existing `get_app_config`/`set_app_config` commands — the same path the copy toggle used, so no
  new command surface. A chord is a normalized string (e.g. `"Mod+Shift+C"`, where `Mod` is
  `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd` on macOS, so one binding is correct cross-platform). Absent
  keys fall back to the defaults above, so an old config and a fresh install both just work.
- **Rebinding UI.** A **Shortcuts** section in the settings popover: each command is a row with
  its current chord shown as a key-cap; clicking `Change` puts the row into capture mode ("press a
  key…"), the next chord is captured, `Esc` abandons capture. A `Reset` per row restores the
  default.
- **Conflict on capture.** If the captured chord already belongs to another Prompts command, the
  capture is **rejected inline** ("`Mod+S` is already Save as…") and nothing is stored — we never
  silently steal a binding from another command. Chords that collide with a *browser/OS* key
  (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+S`) are allowed but shown with a quiet "overrides system default" note, and the
  binding must `preventDefault` to take effect; the selection-aware carve-out for `Ctrl+C` is
  intrinsic to that command and survives rebinding.

## Popover geometry, focus trap, and Escape

| Popover | Anchor | Opens | Focus on open | Escape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Settings/config (gear) | gear near the compose box | **above** the box | first control (or Notices, if unresolved events) | close → focus gear |
| Project manager (`⋯`) | under the tab row | downward | the "New project" name input | close → focus `⋯` |
| Snippet modal | centered over the view | modal | Title (new) / Body (edit) | close → focus compose caret |

**Focus trap + restore (required — folds in the Round-A a11y debt).** While any of the three is
open: `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycle **within** it and never escape to the page behind; the element that
had focus before opening is remembered and re-focused on close. Today none of the three trap or
restore focus (`EmbeddingsPopover`, `ProjectManagerPopover`, `PieceModal` have `Esc` handlers
only). Rationale for making this a build requirement rather than deferred debt: a mouse-off
product where `Tab` silently walks focus behind an open modal is not actually operable without a
mouse — the trap is load-bearing for the north star, not polish.

**Click-away still closes** (the manager and settings popovers already have transparent backdrops)
— click-away and `Esc` are equivalent close gestures, and both restore focus.

## Keyboard operability audit — the mouse-only gaps to close

The single reference list of "works by mouse only today," each resolved by a scenario above.
A builder can treat this as the acceptance checklist for the north star.

| Mouse-only today | Keyboard equivalent to build | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Inserting a match (click a hit) | `↓` into panel, `Enter` to insert | [S2](#s2-newline-search--arrow--enter-insert) |
| Saving the whole box | impossible today; add `Save as…` + `Ctrl/Cmd+S` | [S5](#s5-save-the-whole-box) |
| Saving a selection (floating button) | `Save as…` / `Ctrl/Cmd+S` with a selection | [S6](#s6-save-a-selection) |
| Switching tabs | `←`/`→` roving + `Enter` | [S8](#s8-switch-project-tabs-with-a-draft-in-the-box) |
| Copying | `Ctrl/Cmd+C` selection-aware | [S9](#s9-copy--button-and-hotkey) |
| `Tab` walks focus behind open popovers | focus trap + restore | [Popover focus](#popover-geometry-focus-trap-and-escape) |

## Contract implications

The exact edits [prompts-design.md](prompts-design.md) needs before any build. The lead amends the
contract from this list; nothing here is built until it lands there.

1. **Per-variable as-variable replaces the global toggle** (§Copy output). The `promptsAsVariable`
   AppConfig field is **removed** (backend `appconfig.rs` + frontend `AppConfig` type + the dev
   fallback in `api.ts`). `copyText` changes signature from `(text, fills, asVariable: boolean)` to
   take a **per-name ON/OFF map** (e.g. `asVars: Record<string, boolean>`). The Rust side, which
   never renders copy output, is unaffected — copy stays frontend-only. Document the
   occurrence-based default (JC-1) as the seam both the fill list and the copy builder read.
2. **`piece` → `snippet` rename** touches the command names (`list_pieces`, `save_piece`,
   `delete_piece`, `piece_load_errors`, `MatchHit`/`Piece` types), the schema field references in
   §Piece schema, storage-path prose (`prompts/` file comments say "piece"), and all UI copy. One
   mechanical commit; the contract's own prose renames with it.
3. **Hotkey config storage.** A new `hotkeys: Record<string, string>` on AppConfig with
   default-fallback semantics, persisted via the existing `get_app_config`/`set_app_config`. Add a
   short §Hotkeys to the contract naming the chord-string normalization (`Mod` = Ctrl/Cmd) so both
   platforms store one canonical form.
4. **Snippet-modal save gains a `Save as new` path** (§Compose surface / piece modal). The modal
   today only updates the same id; the contract's modal description must name the two save actions
   and that the edited span text (not the stored body) is the default body when opened from a span.
5. **Auto-repair notice becomes transient + recoverable** (§Store robustness). The contract says
   the recovered flag drives a UI that "shows it needs attention"; tighten that to name the toast +
   settings-badge + Notices model so the transient/durable split is contractual, not incidental.

## Judgment calls (collected)

Marked inline above; gathered here so the founder can overrule cheaply. Each is a call I was
authorized to make, not a fork I need him to resolve.

- **JC-1 — per-variable default** = smart (ON for multi-line/long values, OFF for short).
  Overrule: all-OFF or all-ON. [S4](#s4-fill-variables-per-variable-toggle)
- **JC-2 — Enter-inserts only after an explicit `↓`** into the panel; the first hit is not
  pre-armed to swallow Enter. Overrule: auto-arm the first hit. [S2](#s2-newline-search--arrow--enter-insert)
- **JC-3 — `Original` previews, doesn't revert**; reverting is a separate labeled action.
  [S7](#s7-edit-a-linked-snippet-inline-then-save--update-vs-save-as-new)
- **JC-4 — `Ctrl+C` selection-aware** for full-prompt copy, with `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` as the
  unambiguous alternative shipped alongside. Overrule: leave `Ctrl+C` fully native.
  [S9](#s9-copy--button-and-hotkey)
- **JC-5 — durable data-event trace lives on the settings gear** (badge + Notices), not a
  standalone strip. [S13](#s13-toast-lifecycle-and-recovering-a-repair-notice)
- **JC-6 — one consolidated settings popover** (semantic matching + shortcuts + Notices) anchored
  above the compose box, rather than several small popovers. Rationale: fewer surfaces, matches
  "config lives in a popover"; overrule if the founder wants matching settings kept in the library
  panel where they are today. [S10](#s10-open-and-close-the-popovers)

- **JC-7 — `Update snippet` does not re-sync other inserted copies.** Spans stay point-in-time
  snapshots (the tint marks origin, not liveness), so updating a snippet leaves a second copy of
  it in the box showing the old text. A quiet toast — *"2 other inserted copies left unchanged"* —
  keeps that from being a silent surprise. Overrule: re-sync every live span of that id.
  [S7](#s7-edit-a-linked-snippet-inline-then-save--update-vs-save-as-new)

- **JC-8 — the rebinding UI ships minimal**: per-row change/reset, inline conflict rejection. No
  conflict graph, no keymap import/export until someone actually wants one. [Hotkeys](#hotkey-map)

- **JC-9 — as-var state is session-only**, never persisted to the snippet schema. The
  occurrence-based default ([JC-1](#s4-fill-variables-per-variable-toggle)) already picks right
  most of the time; a per-placeholder `as_var` hint earns its schema change only if re-toggling
  turns out to annoy in practice. [S4](#s4-fill-variables-per-variable-toggle)

## Open questions for the founder

**None block the build.** The forks the first draft left open are resolved above as JC-7…JC-9, each
cheap to overrule — this doc's review *is* the gate, so a call made here costs nothing to reverse
and costs a build round if it is deferred.

Two are worth your eye specifically, because they encode *your* reasoning rather than mine:

- **[JC-1](#s4-fill-variables-per-variable-toggle)** — a variable defaults to as-var when it occurs
  more than once. This reads your "don't repeat verbose content" rationale literally. If what you
  actually wanted is *"long values get the XML wrapper even when used once"* — because the wrapper
  also tells the model "this is a parameter" — say so, and the rule changes.
- **[JC-6](#s10-open-and-close-the-popovers)** — folding the semantic-matching controls into one
  settings popover above the compose box. Your words were "the setting popover should be above the
  compose box," which reads as relocation; this goes further and consolidates. Easy to split back.

## Things the current code contradicts about the stated model

Surfaced plainly, because the founder was feel-checking from memory and these are high-value:

- **Newline-as-search already works** — his delight was well-placed; `caretQuery` already treats
  each line as the query. No change needed there; the missing piece is only the *keyboard path
  into the results* and Enter-insert.
- **"Arrow and Enter, no mouse" is currently impossible end-to-end.** Arrow-nav exists *inside*
  the panel, but there's no keyboard way to reach the panel from the box, and `Enter` never
  inserts. Half-built, not built.
- **You cannot save the whole box today.** The only save affordance requires a selection first.
  The always-present `Save as…` is genuinely new capability, not just a relocated button.
- **The snippet modal shows the *stored* body by default, not the edited one** — the exact
  opposite of "use the edited version by default." And there is no `Save as new` path at all;
  saving from a span always overwrites the same snippet.
- **The repair/error notices are permanent banners today**, not transient — the reverse of "5-
  second dismiss." The work is to make them transient *and* keep the data event recoverable.
- **`as variables` is one global switch today**, not per-variable — his "fine-grain control"
  ask is a real replacement, and it removes a persisted AppConfig field.
