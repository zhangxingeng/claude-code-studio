# Deck

**A friendly control center for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — browse your
history, fix your settings, and launch sessions, all without living in a terminal or hand-editing
JSON.

**Offline** · **Your data never leaves your machine** · **Open source, MIT licensed**

<!-- TODO: capture a short demo GIF walking session → settings edit → launch, and drop it here. -->

## Why Deck exists

Claude Code is remarkably capable, but two things keep it from being for absolutely everyone: **the
command line**, and **a settings system spread across nested JSON files that even experienced
developers lose track of.**

Deck's whole job is to take that wall down. Everything it does follows one rule: **simple by
default, advanced on demand.** The things you do most — read a past conversation, change a setting,
start a new session — are one click away and explained in plain English. The power-user controls
are all still there; they just stay out of your way until you go looking for them.

## Is this for you?

- **You'd rather click than type.** You want to browse and search your Claude Code history, tweak
  settings, and launch sessions without memorizing flags or hand-editing config files.
- **You're new to coding with Claude Code.** You don't need to know what a `.jsonl` file is or where
  `settings.json` lives. Deck shows you what's there and explains it as you go.
- **You're a power user who's tired of losing track of settings.** You know exactly what you want to
  change — you just want to stop guessing which of three files it lives in and which one wins.

Whoever you are, Deck reads and writes the exact same files Claude Code already uses — nothing
proprietary, nothing locked in, nothing you can't open in a text editor if you ever want to.

## What it does

### See everything

Deck finds every Claude Code session on your machine automatically and renders each one as a clean,
readable conversation — not a wall of raw JSON. Markdown renders properly, "thinking" steps collapse
so they don't clutter the page, and tool calls and their results (plus nested sub-agent threads) are
laid out so you can actually follow what happened.

Full-text search covers your entire history at once, with filters for source, date, project, and
tool name, plus keyboard navigation (↑/↓/Enter) so you can move through results without touching the
mouse. Need to send a session to someone else? Export any conversation to a single, standalone HTML
file.

And if you spot something you want to fix, edit any message in place. Every change is backed up
automatically with a word-level diff, full undo/redo, and one-click restore to any earlier version —
so editing history is never a one-way door.

### Config without the JSON

Claude Code settings can live in up to three separate files — user, project, and local — and it's
genuinely hard to know what's set where, or which one wins. Deck reads all three, shows every field
in plain language (pulled straight from Claude Code's own published schema, not guesswork), and
flags conflicts loudly: *"`model` is set in both User and Project — Project wins."*

About 20 of the most common settings are shown by default; the rest — well over a hundred — are one
click away behind a "show advanced settings" toggle. Edit any tier directly and Deck writes exactly
the file you meant to change, nothing merged behind your back.

### Run it your way

Deck doesn't force you into its own built-in console. Launch Claude Code in whatever terminal you
already use — it auto-detects a sensible default so it just works out of the box. Want more control?
An advanced panel lets you pick a specific terminal and pass extra arguments (like
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`), clearly labeled and never in your way unless you ask for it.

Picking up an old conversation is just as easy: resume any past session right where you left off, or
fork a brand-new session starting from any specific message in its history.

## Getting started

Deck is a companion to Claude Code, not a replacement for it — you'll need
[Claude Code installed](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart) first. Once that's set up, Deck
finds your sessions and settings automatically; there's nothing to configure.

Download the installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/zhangxingeng/deck/releases):

| Platform | Files |
|----------|-------|
| Windows  | `.exe` or `.msi` |
| macOS    | `.dmg` (Apple Silicon and Intel) |
| Linux    | `.AppImage` or `.deb` |

### First launch (unsigned builds)

These builds aren't OS-code-signed — per-platform signing certificates are a paid expense a small
open-source project doesn't carry — so your OS may warn you the first time you open the app. That's
expected; here's how to get past it:

- **Windows** — SmartScreen: click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **macOS** — Right-click the app → **Open** → confirm (or System Settings → Privacy & Security →
  Open Anyway).
- **Linux** — For the AppImage, run `chmod +x <file>.AppImage` first.

## Privacy / how it works

Deck runs entirely on your local filesystem. It reads and writes the same session and settings files
Claude Code already uses under `~/.claude/` — nothing is ever uploaded anywhere. The only network
request Deck itself makes is checking for its own updates, and those update artifacts are
cryptographically signed so you can trust they came from this project.

## For developers

Deck is a Tauri v2 + Svelte 5 (TypeScript) desktop app: a Rust backend that's the only thing that
touches the filesystem, and a SvelteKit frontend that does all the parsing and rendering logic in
plain TypeScript so it's easy to test and reason about. Full command contract and data model are in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

```
src-tauri/  Rust — native file access only (reads ~/.claude, settings.json tiers, search index)
src/lib/    TypeScript — pure logic (parsing, session model) + Tauri API wrappers
src/routes/ Svelte 5 — the UI (browse / view / edit / search / settings)
```

### Build from source

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), and the
[Tauri v2 system dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # frontend only, in a browser — fastest loop for UI work
pnpm exec tauri dev   # full desktop app with native file access
pnpm exec tauri build # installable bundles (.deb/.rpm/.AppImage on Linux, equivalent per-OS elsewhere)
```

## Contributing

Deck is a small open-source project, and contributions of any size are genuinely welcome — code,
bug reports, docs fixes, or just telling us something's confusing.

- **Found a bug or have an idea?** Open an
  [issue](https://github.com/zhangxingeng/deck/issues/new/choose) — there are templates for bug
  reports and feature requests to help you include what we need.
- **Want to send a PR?** [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full dev setup, the checks to
  run before opening one (`pnpm check`, `cargo test --lib`, `pnpm build`), and the PR template will
  walk you through the rest.
- **Not sure where to start?** Docs fixes and README improvements never need an issue first — just
  open a PR. For code, `docs/roadmap.md` tracks what's shipped, what's planned, and what's been
  explicitly deferred, which is a good way to find something that isn't already spoken for.

The guiding principle for any change: **simple by default, advanced on demand.** If you're not sure
whether a new control belongs up front or behind an "Advanced" toggle, default to hiding it.

## FAQ

**Does Deck send my conversations anywhere?** No. Everything happens locally; the only network call
Deck makes is its own update check.

**Does Deck replace Claude Code?** No — it's a control center *for* Claude Code. You still need
Claude Code installed; Deck makes it easier to see, configure, and launch.

**Will editing settings in Deck break something?** Deck writes exactly the tier you edit, in the
same JSON format Claude Code reads — nothing is merged behind your back, and conflicts across tiers
are called out before you save.

**Is Deck affiliated with Anthropic?** No — see the disclaimer below. It's an independent project
built to make an existing tool friendlier, not an official product.
